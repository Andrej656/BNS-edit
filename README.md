Project goal

Our goal is to enhance the functionality and usability of the BNS. We will begin by creating a website that effectively showcases the essence of BNS. Following this, we plan to develop comprehensive Gitbook documentation covering the technology's architecture and providing detailed explanations. A key aspect of our website will be the integration of a BNS app, offering users the ability to renew BNS holdings and earn yields simply by holding BNS on our platform. Leveraging the power of POX and integration with stacking and fastpool, users will enjoy passive income. We will also develop a Rest API to facilitate seamless integration of this functionality into other platforms. Importantly, when users stake BNS through our app, they receive identical assets in their wallet, ensuring the sole ownership of specific assets through the power of Clarity smart contracts. When users choose to unstake their assets, only they can withdraw them from the platform

End Product

We aim to significantly enhance the BNS (Bitcoin Name System) experience for the community by implementing a comprehensive suite of tools designed for the optimal management and utility of BNS names within the Stacks ecosystem. Our proposed enhancements include:

Development of a REST API to seamlessly integrate BNS with decentralized applications (dApps) in the Stacks network, thereby enriching the functionality available to BNS holders.
Provision of a robust set of tools tailored for the BNS/Stacks community, facilitating essential services such as registration and renewal of BNS names, potentially including bulk renewal options. This suite will also support the maintenance and update of zone files, addition of subdomains, and DNS connections. Moreover, the tools are designed to be forward-compatible with BNS Version 2, ensuring a seamless and enhanced user experience.
Introduction of a novel feature enabling BNS holders to earn yields from Proof of Transfer (PoX) cycles by simply holding their BNS names. This initiative aims to further empower the community and encourage broader participation.
Our overarching goal is to equip BNS holders with a desperately needed, state-of-the-art toolkit that not only enhances their current capabilities but also prepares BNS for wider adoption and higher utility across the ecosystem.
